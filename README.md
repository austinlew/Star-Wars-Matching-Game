# Star Wars Matching Game Project 1


## Game Description - Matching Card Game
This game tests your memory but in a fun way, if you enjoy Star Wars as much as I do then this will be fun for you. First, you want to choose one card and flip it over next you want to flip another card and if is the same card the game will keep the cards shown upwards, if they are not the same card then the game will flip it back over. You will have to find all of the matching cards in those 30 seconds, if not, that big Death Star in the back will destroy your computer. Just kidding. But if you do get all of the matching cards before the timer hits 0 seconds, YOU WIN! Keep playing again over and over to try to get a lower score on the timer. Enjoy!

## Technologies Used
I used HTML to get the base of everything put together, I put my front and back images, play again button and audio in here as well.

My CSS was used to style the game and to get it the way I wanted it to look with placement, colors and fonts.

Javascript was the brain of everything to get all of my functionalities work to flip the cards, understand the win/lose logic of the game, my timer to run, to find the cards that match, to have the cards flip back over if they don't match and after all of it for the play again button to rest and shuffle all the cards.

## Challenging Coding Parts
My images were not working until I figured out the problem

Win or loss was not showing up whenever player won or lost the game but the problem was that I didn't invoke the function in the correct area which ended up working when I changed it

## Next Steps
In the future I would like to clean up the code and make it shorter if I can and also add some more animations including a moving background/video and even add different sounds depending on the character you choose on the cards. Also, I would want to add a animation on the cards shuffling and when the cards don't match the cards show a shake animation.
