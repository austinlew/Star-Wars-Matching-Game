# Star Wars Matching Game Project 1


## Game Description - Matching Card Game
Find all the characters from Star Wars to save the galaxy! To do so first, you must choose two cards and if they match then congrats you have found your first character and those two cards will stay facing up. If you choose two cards and they don't match then the cards will flip back over, try to find all of the characters within 35 seconds. If not, that big Death Star in the back will destroy the universe and the game is over. Save the planet at your own risk, enjoy!

## Technologies Used
I used HTML to get the base of everything put together, I put my front and back images, play again button and audio in here as well.

My CSS was used to style the game and to get it the way I wanted it to look with placement, colors and fonts.

Javascript was the brain of everything to get all of my functionalities work to flip the cards, understand the win/lose logic of the game, my timer to run, to find the cards that match, to have the cards flip back over if they don't match and after all of it for the play again button to rest and shuffle all the cards.

## Next Steps
In the future I would like to clean up the code and make it shorter if I can and also add some more animations including a moving background/video and even add different sounds depending on the character you choose on the cards. Also, I would want to add a animation on the cards shuffling and when the cards don't match the cards show a shake animation.
